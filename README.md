# BatteryModelOptimizer

## Overview
BatteryModelOptimizer is a sophisticated framework designed to refine and adjust electrochemical model parameters for batteries. This system leverages both empirical laboratory data and synthetic data generated through dedicated simulators to closely align with real-world battery behavior.

## Key Features
- **Dual-stage Optimization**: Implements a two-stage process to optimize both non-degradation and degradation battery parameters.
- **Data Integration**: Combines empirical and synthetic data to enhance the predictive accuracy of battery behavior across various scenarios.
- **AI Model Training**: Facilitates the development of AI models that predict battery life expectancy and performance efficiently.

## Getting Started
To get started with BatteryModelOptimizer, please follow the installation and setup instructions below:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Relevant Python libraries: numpy, scipy, matplotlib

### Installation
